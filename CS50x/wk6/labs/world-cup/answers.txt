Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

As I increased the number of simulations, the predictions of countries with smaller chances of winning was proved incorrect.
At 10 simulations, only Belgium stands in the correct place; the rest of the countries correct their standings, with the final simulation putting Japan in last place.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

I would say predictions stabilized around the 10000 simulation count. The higher simulations just seem to add more countries that have barely any chance to win.
